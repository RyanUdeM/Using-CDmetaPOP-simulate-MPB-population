Internship at JamesLab 2017-2018

Intern Researcher - Computational Biology
2017 - 2018
JamesLab, Université de Montréal
Research project: Using simulation method to study the impact of epidemic frequency and dispersal capacity over pest population genetic
structure.
Languages and software used: R, Python, CDmetaPOP, ComputeCanada, Globus

Jan 2018 - Aug 2018
Filtered simulation data, converted sampled data into different data structures for different statistic tests needs. Analyzed, using bio-statistics
tests, the simulation data under R programming environment. Interpreted the statistic results.

Jan 2017 - Aug 2017
Simulated population genetic data using python-based simulator program CDmetaPOP. Coded a R pipeline to take different biological scenario
inputs and to output the corresponding simulation data.

Achievement: Presented, as the only undergraduate researcher from UdeM, the project in CSEE 2018 (Canadian Society for Ecology and
Evolution) at Guelph, Ontario
